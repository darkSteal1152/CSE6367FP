IMAGE_FOLDER_GOES_HERE needs to be replaced with file path to image folder

image_folder = r'IMAGE_FOLDER_GOES_HERE'

or 

SINGLE_IMAGE_CAN_GO_HERE needs to be replaced with single image file path

selected_images = random.sample(image_paths, min(2, len(image_paths)))
#selected_images = [r'SINGLE_IMAGE_CAN_GO_HERE']
